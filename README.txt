Server:
- Navigate to the server folder
- Update config.py with your Postgres credentials (may need to create a new Postgres database)
- run py app.py

Client:
- Navigate to the client folder 
- run flutter run chrome

Misc Notes:
- Will have to refresh (log back in) to see new messages
- If creating a group conversation, please separate usernames by commas and do not include any spaces 

Next Steps:
- Automatically trigger frontend changes when database is updated
- Add more message functionality (forward, delete)
- Allow users to change their passwords, delete their accounts
- Message encryption (so messages aren't stored in plaintext in the database)
